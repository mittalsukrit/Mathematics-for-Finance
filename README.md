# Mathematics for Finance

This repository contains comprehensive lecture notes for the open elective course **Mathematics for Finance** taught at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).

**Instructor:** [Sukrit Mittal](https://mittalsukrit.github.io/) (Franklin Templeton Investments)

The material introduces the **mathematical foundations of modern financial systems** with emphasis on structure, abstraction, and rigor rather than recipes or rules. These are written as **proper lecture notes**, not slide dumps.

## Course Overview

This course covers:
- How to model financial markets mathematically
- How to quantify and manage risk
- How to value assets under uncertainty
- The computational tools that power modern finance
