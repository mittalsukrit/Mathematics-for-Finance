<h2 id="course-introduction">Course Introduction</h2>
<p>This course introduces the <strong>mathematical foundations of modern
financial systems</strong>.<br />
The emphasis is not on rules or recipes, but on <strong>structure,
abstraction, and rigor</strong>.</p>
<p>Finance today is inseparable from mathematics, computation, and
uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll learn:</strong> - How to model financial markets
mathematically - How to quantify and manage risk - How to value assets
under uncertainty - The computational tools that power modern
finance</p>
<p><strong>What you won’t learn:</strong> - How to get rich quick -
Stock tips or market predictions</p>

<h2 id="what-is-quantitative-finance">What is Quantitative Finance?</h2>
<p>Quantitative finance is the <strong>mathematics, statistics, and
computing engine</strong> that drives modern financial markets.</p>
<p>It exists because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Financial markets have grown too complex for pure
intuition.</strong><br />
With thousands of assets, interdependent risks, and global connections,
human intuition alone cannot process the complexity. Mathematical models
provide a structured way to understand these systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset prices evolve under uncertainty and randomness —
precisely what mathematics formalizes.</strong><br />
We don’t know what Apple’s stock will be worth tomorrow, but we can
model the probability distribution of possible outcomes. This is where
stochastic calculus, probability theory, and statistics become essential
tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computers allow simulation, optimization, and testing at
massive scale.</strong><br />
We can backtest strategies on decades of historical data, run Monte
Carlo simulations with millions of scenarios, and optimize portfolios
across thousands of assets—all in seconds. This computational power has
transformed finance from an art to a science.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finance-runs-on-code">1. Finance Runs on Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banks, hedge funds, payment systems, and exchanges are

Care About Financial Systems?</h2>
<p>Finance is no longer a separate industry.<br />
It is a <strong>mission-critical distributed computing
system</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="algorithms-rule-the-battlefield">2. Algorithms Rule the
Battlefield</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-frequency trading:</strong> Algorithms execute
thousands of trades per second, exploiting tiny price
discrepancies.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud detection:</strong> Machine learning models analyze
transaction patterns in real-time to flag suspicious activity.</li>
<li><strong>Risk management:</strong> Complex algorithms calculate
Value-at-Risk (VaR), stress test portfolios, and manage collateral
requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio optimization:</strong> Algorithms balance risk and
return across hundreds or thousands of securities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many core computer science innovations—low-latency systems, streaming
pipelines, secure computation—were pioneered in finance. The financial
industry was building distributed systems and real-time data processing
long before “big data” became a buzzword.</p>

<h2 id="financial-literacy-as-career-leverage">Financial Literacy as
Career Leverage</h2>
<p>If you understand <strong>both code and capital</strong>, you are
rare—and rarity has value.</p>
<p>Old view: &gt; Engineers build apps, finance people handle money.</p>
<p>Current reality: &gt; Those who understand both design the systems
that move markets.</p>
<p><strong>Career opportunities at the intersection:</strong> -
Quantitative analyst (quant) at hedge funds and banks - Algorithmic
trading developer - Risk management technologist - Fintech entrepreneur
- Blockchain developer</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-financial-system">What is a Financial System?</h2>
<p>A <strong>financial system</strong> exists to coordinate economic
activity across <strong>time and uncertainty</strong>.</p>
<p>At its core, it performs three fundamental functions.</p>
<p><strong>Think about it this way:</strong> 1. You have an idea for a
startup but no money (<em>capital allocation</em> problem) 2. A farmer
worries about crop prices falling next season (<em>risk transfer</em>
problem) 3. An investor wants to know if Tesla is overvalued (<em>price
discovery</em> problem)</p>
<p>The financial system provides mechanisms to solve all three.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h3 id="capital-allocation-problem">1. Capital Allocation Problem</h3>
<p>Deciding <strong>where money should go</strong>.</p>
<p>Capital is scarce.<br />
The system must direct it toward projects and assets with the best
expected return for the risk taken.</p>
<p>This happens through: - <strong>Investment decisions:</strong>
Venture capitalists funding startups, institutional investors buying
stocks - <strong>Lending:</strong> Banks providing loans to businesses
and consumers - <strong>Equity financing:</strong> Companies raising
capital by issuing shares</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Efficient capital allocation means
productive companies get funded while failing ones don’t. This drives
economic growth. Misallocation (e.g., real estate bubbles, zombie
companies) destroys value and causes crises.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When you deposit ₹100,000 in a bank, that
money doesn’t sit idle. The bank lends it to businesses or homebuyers.
Your savings are allocated to productive uses, and you earn interest in
return.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h3 id="risk-transfer-problem">2. Risk Transfer Problem</h3>
<p>Shifting risk from one party to another using financial
instruments.</p>
<p>Examples: - <strong>Insurance:</strong> You pay a premium to transfer
risk of loss to an insurance company - <strong>Derivatives:</strong> A
farmer locks in wheat prices using futures contracts, transferring price
risk to speculators - <strong>Hedging contracts:</strong> An airline
buys oil futures to protect against rising fuel costs</p>
<p>Purpose: - <strong>Allow specialization:</strong> A farmer farms, a
bank prices risk. Each does what they do best. - <strong>Spread risk
across many participants:</strong> Instead of one person bearing
catastrophic loss, risk is distributed across thousands of
counterparties. - <strong>Enable calculated risk-taking:</strong>
Businesses can take productive risks (R&amp;D, expansion) while hedging
away unproductive ones (currency fluctuations, commodity prices).</p>
<p><strong>Without risk transfer:</strong> - Airlines would face
bankruptcy risk from oil price spikes - Farmers couldn’t invest in next
season’s crop - International trade would be paralyzed by currency
risk</p>
<p><strong>The mathematical challenge:</strong> How do we price these
risk transfers fairly? This is where quantitative finance becomes
critical.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h3 id="price-discovery-problem">3. Price Discovery Problem</h3>
<p>Determining <strong>what an asset is worth right now</strong>.</p>
<p>Markets aggregate: <strong>Information</strong>,
<strong>Expectations</strong>, <strong>Sentiment</strong>.</p>
<p>Prices act as <strong>signals</strong>, guiding decisions and
allocating resources efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> - If a stock is undervalued, buyers
bid it up - If it’s overvalued, sellers drive it down - The equilibrium
price reflects the collective wisdom (or folly) of all market
participants</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When Apple announces record iPhone sales,
the stock price rises immediately. The new price incorporates this
information without any central authority setting it. Millions of
traders, algorithms, and investors update their valuations, and the
market finds a new equilibrium in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Price discovery allows resources to
flow to their most valued uses. If Tesla’s stock price falls, it becomes
harder for the company to raise capital—the market is signaling that
resources should go elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>The dark side:</strong> Price discovery can fail during
panics, bubbles, or when markets become illiquid. This is why market
microstructure and behavioral finance are important fields.</p>

Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li>Money Market</li>
<li>Capital Market
<ul>
<li>Equity Market</li>
<li>Debt Market</li>
<li>Derivatives Market</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="money-markets-vs.-capital-market">Money Markets vs. Capital
Market</h2>
<h3 id="money-market">Money Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>Short-term borrowing and lending (maturity ≤ 1 year)</li>
<li>Primarily regulated by the RBI</li>
<li>Used to manage liquidity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> - <strong>Very low risk:</strong>
Short duration means less exposure to default or interest rate changes -
<strong>Returns linked to policy rates:</strong> Typically close to the
repo rate or overnight rates - <strong>High liquidity:</strong> Easy to
buy and sell quickly</p>
<p><strong>Common instruments:</strong> - Treasury bills (T-bills) -
Commercial paper (short-term corporate debt) - Certificates of deposit
(CDs) - Repurchase agreements (repos)</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Money markets are the “working capital” of
the financial system. Banks use them to manage day-to-day liquidity, and
the RBI uses them to implement monetary policy.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="money-market-vs.-capital-market">Money Market vs. Capital
Market</h2>
<h3 id="capital-market">Capital Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>Long-term securities (maturity &gt; 1 year)</li>
<li>Regulated by SEBI (and RBI for certain debt)</li>
<li>Used to fund growth and infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> - <strong>Higher risk:</strong>
Longer time horizon means more uncertainty and price volatility -
<strong>Higher expected returns:</strong> Investors demand compensation
for taking on more risk - <strong>Sensitive to economic growth and
earnings:</strong> Long-term performance drives valuations</p>
<p><strong>Common instruments:</strong> - Stocks (equity) - Corporate
bonds - Government bonds with maturity &gt; 1 year - Mutual funds and
ETFs</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Capital markets fund long-term
investments—building factories, infrastructure projects, R&amp;D.
Companies raise capital here to grow, while investors seek returns over
years or decades.</p>
<p><strong>Key difference from money markets:</strong> Capital markets
are about <strong>growth and wealth creation</strong>, while money
markets are about <strong>liquidity management and safety</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="capital-markets">Capital Markets</h2>
<h3 id="equity-market">Equity Market</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Ownership in a company. When you buy a
share, you own a piece of that business.</li>
<li><strong>Returns:</strong> Dividends (profit sharing) + capital gains
(increase in stock price)</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> High, tied to firm performance and market
sentiment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why companies issue equity:</strong> To raise capital without
taking on debt. Shareholders bear the risk but also get the upside.</p>
<p><strong>Why investors buy equity:</strong> Potential for high returns
over long periods. Historically, equities outperform bonds and cash over
decades.</p>
<p>Example: Buying shares of Reliance Industries on NSE. You become a
partial owner of one of India’s largest conglomerates.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="capital-markets-1">Capital Markets</h2>
<h3 id="debt-market">Debt Market</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Lending money in exchange for interest.
You’re a creditor, not an owner.</li>
<li><strong>Returns:</strong> Fixed interest + principal repayment</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Lower than equity, but subject to default
risk (the borrower might not pay back)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why companies/governments issue debt:</strong> To raise
capital while maintaining control (unlike equity, bondholders don’t get
ownership or voting rights).</p>
<p><strong>Why investors buy debt:</strong> Stable, predictable income.
Useful for conservative investors or portfolio diversification.</p>
<p>Example: Holding a 10-year Government of India bond paying 7% annual
interest. You lend money to the government, and they promise to pay you
back with interest.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="capital-markets-2">Capital Markets</h2>
<h3 id="derivatives-market">Derivatives Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contracts derived from an underlying asset (stocks, bonds,
commodities, currencies)</li>
<li>Used for:
<ul>
<li><strong>Hedging:</strong> Reducing risk (e.g., an airline hedging
fuel costs)</li>
<li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Betting on price movements with
leverage</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage:</strong> Exploiting price differences between
markets</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Types: - <strong>Futures:</strong> Obligation to buy/sell at a future
date at a predetermined price - <strong>Options:</strong> Right (not
obligation) to buy/sell at a predetermined price -
<strong>Swaps:</strong> Exchange of cash flows (e.g., fixed vs. floating
interest rates)</p>
<p><strong>Power and danger:</strong> Derivatives provide leverage—you
can control large positions with small capital. This magnifies both
gains and losses. The 2008 crisis was partly caused by complex
derivatives that few understood.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A Nifty 50 futures contract allows you to
bet on (or hedge against) the movement of India’s benchmark stock index
without buying all 50 stocks.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="financial-institutions">Financial Institutions</h2>
<h3 id="banks">Banks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accept deposits</li>
<li>Make loans</li>
<li>Provide payment services</li>
</ul>
<p>In India, banks are central to: - <strong>Money markets:</strong>
Banks are major participants in overnight lending - <strong>Government
securities:</strong> Major holders of G-Secs - <strong>Credit
creation:</strong> Through fractional reserve banking, banks create
money by lending out deposits</p>
<p><strong>How banks make money:</strong> - Net interest margin
(difference between lending and deposit rates) - Fees (transaction fees,
account maintenance) - Trading and investment income</p>
<p><strong>Why banks matter:</strong> They’re the plumbing of the
financial system. When banks fail, credit freezes, and economies
contract. This is why banking regulation is so strict.</p>
<p>Examples: SBI (India’s largest public sector bank), HDFC Bank
(largest private sector bank).</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="financial-institutions-1">Financial Institutions</h2>
<h3 id="exchanges">Exchanges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Organized platforms for buying and selling securities</li>
<li>Ensure transparency, liquidity, and price discovery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What exchanges provide:</strong> -
<strong>Standardization:</strong> All trades follow the same rules and
procedures - <strong>Clearing and settlement:</strong> Guarantee that
trades are completed correctly - <strong>Market surveillance:</strong>
Monitor for manipulation and insider trading -
<strong>Liquidity:</strong> Bring together many buyers and sellers,
making it easy to trade</p>
<p><strong>Electronic vs. physical:</strong> Modern exchanges are almost
entirely electronic. Trading happens in microseconds through matching
engines.</p>
<p>Examples: - <strong>India:</strong> NSE (National Stock Exchange -
largest by volume), BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange - oldest in Asia) -
<strong>US:</strong> NYSE (New York Stock Exchange - largest by market
cap), NASDAQ (tech-heavy, fully electronic)</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> NSE’s trading system can handle 40,000
orders per second. This computational infrastructure is what makes
modern markets possible.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="financial-institutions-2">Financial Institutions</h2>
<h3 id="funds">Funds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pool money from multiple investors</li>
<li>Invest across asset classes</li>
<li>Provide diversification and professional management</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types:</strong> - <strong>Mutual funds:</strong> Actively or
passively managed portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other assets -
<strong>ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds):</strong> Trade like stocks but
hold diversified portfolios - <strong>Hedge funds:</strong> Private
funds using sophisticated strategies (often restricted to wealthy
investors) - <strong>Pension funds:</strong> Long-term investment
vehicles for retirement savings</p>
<p><strong>Why funds matter:</strong> -
<strong>Diversification:</strong> Small investors can own pieces of
hundreds of companies - <strong>Professional management:</strong> Fund
managers have expertise and resources individual investors lack -
<strong>Economies of scale:</strong> Lower transaction costs and better
access to research</p>
<p>Examples: - <strong>Mutual funds:</strong> HDFC Top 100 Fund, ICICI
Prudential Bluechip Fund - <strong>ETFs:</strong> SBI ETF Nifty 50
(tracks the Nifty index)</p>

<section class="slide">
<h2 id="financial-regulators">Financial Regulators</h2>
<h3 id="sebi-securities-and-exchange-board-of-india">SEBI (Securities
and Exchange Board of India)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regulates capital markets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)</li>
<li>Enforces disclosure and transparency requirements</li>
<li>Protects investors from fraud and manipulation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key responsibilities:</strong> - Approving IPOs and ensuring
proper disclosure - Regulating mutual funds and portfolio managers -
Monitoring insider trading and market manipulation - Setting rules for
brokers and exchanges</p>
<p><strong>Recent actions:</strong> SEBI has cracked down on “pump and
dump” schemes, imposed stricter disclosure norms, and pushed for faster
settlement (now T+1, meaning trades settle in one day).</p>
<p>US equivalent: SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission).</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="financial-regulators-1">Financial Regulators</h2>
<h3 id="rbi-reserve-bank-of-india">RBI (Reserve Bank of India)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Central bank of India</li>
<li>Controls monetary policy (interest rates, money supply)</li>
<li>Regulates banks and financial institutions</li>
<li>Oversees money markets and payment systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key tools:</strong> - <strong>Repo rate:</strong> The rate at
which RBI lends to banks (affects all other interest rates) -
<strong>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):</strong> Fraction of deposits banks
must hold with RBI - <strong>Open market operations:</strong>
Buying/selling government bonds to control liquidity</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The RBI’s decisions ripple through
the entire economy. When RBI raises rates, borrowing becomes expensive,
which slows growth but controls inflation. When it cuts rates, borrowing
becomes cheap, stimulating growth.</p>
<p><strong>Recent focus:</strong> Digital payments (UPI), inflation
targeting (maintaining CPI around 4%), and financial stability.</p>
<p>US equivalent: Federal Reserve (The Fed).</p>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p><strong>Financial markets/instruments:</strong> -
<strong>Equity</strong> = ownership (high risk, high potential return) -
<strong>Debt</strong> = lending (lower risk, predictable return)<br />
- <strong>Derivatives</strong> = risk transfer or speculation (leverage
and complexity)</p>
<p><strong>Financial institutions:</strong> - <strong>Banks</strong> =
move and create money (the plumbing of finance) -
<strong>Exchanges</strong> = enable trading and price discovery (the
marketplaces) - <strong>Funds</strong> = pool and allocate capital
(diversification and management)</p>
<p><strong>Financial Regulators:</strong> - <strong>SEBI</strong> =
protect investors and ensure market integrity - <strong>RBI</strong> =
control monetary policy and banking stability</p>
<p>A financial system is not just about money.<br />
It is about <strong>coordination, incentives, and control under
uncertainty</strong>.</p>
