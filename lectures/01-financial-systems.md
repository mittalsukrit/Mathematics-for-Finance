# Overview of Financial Systems


## Motivation
Finance exists to allocate capital across time and uncertainty.


This course focuses on the **mathematics** that makes this possible.


## Financial Markets


We distinguish between:
- Money markets
- Capital markets
- Derivatives markets


## A First Mathematical Object


Let $C_t$ denote cash flow at time $t$.


The present value is defined as:


$$
PV = \sum_{t=0}^T \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$


This simple expression will reappear throughout the course.


## What Comes Next


We now formalize discounting, compounding, and arbitrage.
