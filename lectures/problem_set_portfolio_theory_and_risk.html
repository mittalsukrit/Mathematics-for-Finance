Portfolio Construction for a Financial Advisor</h2>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>You are a quantitative analyst at a wealth management firm. A
financial advisor needs your help creating an optimal investment plan
for a new client. The client has a moderate risk tolerance and wants to
invest in a portfolio of three well-known stocks: - <strong>“TechGrowth
Inc.” (TGI)</strong> - <strong>“SteadyDividends Corp.” (SDC)</strong> -
<strong>“GlobalInnovate Ltd.” (GIL)</strong></p>
<p>Your team has provided the following forecasts for the next year:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Asset</th>
<th>Expected Return (E[R])</th>
<th>Volatility (Std. Dev, σ)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TGI</td>
<td>15%</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SDC</td>
<td>8%</td>
<td>18%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GIL</td>
<td>12%</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The correlation matrix between the asset returns is:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>TGI</th>
<th>SDC</th>
<th>GIL</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>TGI</strong></td>
<td>1.0</td>
<td>0.2</td>
<td>0.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>SDC</strong></td>
<td>0.2</td>
<td>1.0</td>
<td>0.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>GIL</strong></td>
<td>0.4</td>
<td>0.3</td>
<td>1.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The current risk-free rate is 3%.</p>
<p><strong>Your Task:</strong></p>
<p>The advisor sends you a request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I need to show the client how we can build a superior portfolio. Can
you run the numbers? I want to see the efficient frontier, find the best
possible risky portfolio, and then figure out the final allocation for a
client with a risk-aversion coefficient of 3.5. Show your work so I can
explain the logic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What to deliver:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Efficient Frontier:</strong> Plot the efficient frontier
of the three risky assets. Highlight the Global Minimum Variance (GMV)
portfolio on your plot.</li>
<li><strong>The Optimal Risky Portfolio:</strong> Calculate the weights,
expected return, and volatility of the tangency (optimal risky)
portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>The Capital Allocation Line (CAL):</strong> What is the
equation of the CAL that passes through the optimal risky
portfolio?</li>
<li><strong>The Client’s Complete Portfolio:</strong> Determine the
optimal allocation for this specific client <span
class="math inline">\((\gamma=3.5)\)</span> between the risk-free asset
and the optimal risky portfolio. What are the weights in TGI, SDC, and
GIL for this client’s final portfolio?</li>

id="problem-2-project-valuation-using-the-capital-asset-pricing-model-capm">Problem
2: Project Valuation using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</h2>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>You are a strategic finance analyst at a large technology
conglomerate. The R&amp;D division has proposed a new, ambitious project
in the Artificial Intelligence space. The project requires a significant
upfront investment and is expected to generate cash flows over the next
10 years.</p>
<p>The CFO is skeptical and has tasked you with evaluating whether the
project’s expected return justifies its risk.</p>
<p>Market Data: - 10-Year Government Bond Rate (Risk-Free Rate): 4.0% -
Expected Return on the Market Portfolio (e.g., S&amp;P 500): 11.0%</p>
<p>Project &amp; Company Data: - The project’s internal rate of return
(IRR) is estimated to be 14.5%. - Your company’s stock has a beta of
1.2. - However, this AI project is significantly riskier than the
company’s average business. You have identified three publicly traded
“pure-play” AI companies with the following betas: - AI Corp A: 1.6 - AI
Corp B: 1.8 - AI Corp C: 1.7</p>
<p><strong>Your Task:</strong></p>
<p>The CFO emails you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is this AI project a go or no-go? Don’t just use the IRR. I need a
market-based assessment. Calculate the appropriate required rate of
return for this specific project using CAPM. Is it creating value for
our shareholders or is it just a risky bet?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What to deliver:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Estimate the Project Beta:</strong> Determine and justify an
appropriate beta for the AI project. Why shouldn’t you use your
company’s beta of 1.2?</li>
<li><strong>Calculate the Required Rate of Return:</strong> Using the
CAPM, calculate the cost of equity (the required return) for this
project.</li>
<li><strong>Draw the Security Market Line (SML):</strong> Sketch the SML
and plot both the market portfolio and the proposed AI project on
it.</li>
<li><strong>Make a Recommendation:</strong> Is the project’s expected
return of 14.5% sufficient to compensate for its systematic risk?
Explain your recommendation to the CFO with reference to the SML and the
concept of ‘alpha’.</li>

id="problem-3-hedge-fund-risk-assessment-with-utility-and-var">Problem
3: Hedge Fund Risk Assessment with Utility and VaR</h2>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>You are a junior risk manager at a hedge fund. The fund’s flagship
“Global Macro” portfolio is valued at $500 million. Based on historical
data, the portfolio’s annual expected return is 18% with a volatility of
20%. You can assume the returns are approximately normally
distributed.</p>
<p>The portfolio manager has a quadratic utility function of the form:
<span class="math inline">\(U=E[R] - \gamma \sigma^2 / 2\)</span>, with
a risk aversion coefficient of 4.</p>
<p><strong>Your Task:</strong></p>
<p>The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) wants a risk report on the
portfolio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Give me a snapshot of our risk profile. First, tell me the 1-day 99%
VaR. Our internal limit is $5 million. Are we in breach? Also, the PM is
considering a new trade that would reduce volatility to 18% but also
lower the expected return to 16.5%. Should she take it, from a utility
perspective?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What to deliver:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Utility Analysis:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Calculate the utility of the current portfolio for the manager.</li>
<li>Calculate the utility of the proposed new portfolio (with the new
trade).</li>
<li>Based purely on this utility model, should the portfolio manager
make the trade?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Convert the annual return and volatility to daily figures. (Assume
252 trading days in a year).</li>
<li>Calculate the 1-day Value at Risk (VaR) at a 99% confidence level in
dollar terms.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Limit Compliance:</strong> Does the portfolio’s
1-day 99% VaR exceed the internal limit of $5 million?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conceptual Discussion:</strong> The CRO follows up, “What
if the portfolio returns are not normal, but have ‘fat tails’? What does
that mean for our VaR calculation? Is our current VaR estimate likely to
be too high or too low in that case?” Provide a brief, non-technical
explanation.</p></li>
